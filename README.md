# SimpleBashUtilits
Simple implementation of utilities "cat" and "grep" on language C.

In this project I have developed basic Bash utilities for working with C programming language texts. These utilities (cat and grep) are often used in the Linux terminal. The project was developed of C11 standard using gcc compiler and for version BSD 2.5.

The project includes:
1. Utility cat with supporting flags "-b, -e, -n, -s, -t" and GNU versions of it "--number-nonblank, -E, --number, --squeeze-blank, -T".
2. Utility grep with supporting flags "-e, -i, -v, -c, -l, -n".

All code is the property of Anton Tuzov.
