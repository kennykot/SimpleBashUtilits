# SimpleBashUtilits
Simple implementation of utilities "cat" and "grep" on language C.

In this project I have developed basic Bash utilities for working with C programming language texts. These utilities (cat and grep) are often used in the Linux terminal. Project developed of C11 standard using gcc compiler.

The project includes:
1. Utility cat with supporting flags "-b, -e, -n, -s, -t" and GNU versions of it "--number-nonblank, -E, --number, --squeeze-blank, -T".
2. Utility grep with supporting flags "-e, -i, -v, -c, -l, -n".

The repository is updated from time to time. All code is the property of Anton Tuzov.
